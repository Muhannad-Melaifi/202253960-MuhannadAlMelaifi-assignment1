# AI Usage Report (Assignment 1)

## Tools Used & Use Cases
### ChatGPT
- Generated an initial project structure aligned with the assignment rubric.
- Drafted starter HTML sections (About, Projects, Contact) with clean semantic markup.
- Suggested responsive CSS patterns using Grid/Flexbox.
- Helped implement JavaScript features: theme toggle, time-based greeting, and form validation.
- Used to generate project images from my own projects.


### Benefits
- Faster development from a working starting point.
- Helped catch missing rubric requirements early (sections, responsiveness, JS feature, documentation).
- Provided ideas for UI/UX like placeholders for missing images and toast feedback.

### Challenges 
- Some code needed simplification to match course level and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Required manual review to ensure correctness and that all features work together.

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of responsive layout planning (Grid vs Flex).
- Practiced validating user input in JavaScript and giving clear UI feedback.
- Improved documentation habits

## Responsible Use & Modifications
- Reviewed all generated code lines and rewrote parts to ensure I understand it.
- Tested responsiveness using browser DevTools and fixed layout issues.
- Ensured no direct copying from external sources and documented AI use transparently.
